A mixed variety of hardwood trees were planted on April 28 by employees of FirstEnergy and its Ohio Edison electric company throughout the MetroParks' 402-acre farm in Canfield. Since April 2021, FirstEnergy has donated and planted more than 17,000 trees throughout its five-state service territory. The company is on track to plant more than 14,000 additional trees this spring. This initiative is an important part of the company's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, promote responsible use of natural resources and further the advancement of sustainable practices. Led by FirstEnergy's Green Team in northeast Ohio, the Mill Creek MetroParks tree-planting event is one of several projects employees will complete this year to help nearby parks, nature preserves and communities across FirstEnergy's entire footprint. \"FirstEnergy contributed the funds to cover the cost of the trees, and more than a dozen employee volunteers spent several hours planting them around the park, which will be enjoyed by the public and many of our local employees and their families,\" said Carol Trembly, senior scientist and Green Team leader at FirstEnergy. FirstEnergy's 10 Green Teams consist of employees from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia who volunteer their time and talents to support a wide variety of environmental initiatives. The groups plan to continue to partner with state park systems, watershed and recycling groups, garden clubs, schools and other environmentally focused organizations in the future to support FirstEnergy's commitment to building a brighter and more sustainable future. This year's donation of trees to Mill Creek MetroParks complements FirstEnergy's donation of 300 trees planted at the MetroParks' Collier Preserve last year on Earth Day. \"These trees will help restore forested habitat within the park that we've lost over the years, and we look forward to monitoring the trees and helping them along as they mature,\" said Nick Derico, natural resources manager at Mill Creek MetroParks. \"We appreciate FirstEnergy and Ohio Edison's commitment to preserving our local environment so that our trees and wildlife can continue to thrive for many years.\" In addition to the trees that were donated and planted at the Mill Creek MetroParks Farm, FirstEnergy plans to donate 400 trees to the Poland Municipal Forest in Poland on Friday, April 29, to celebrate Arbor Day.

A mixed variety of hardwood trees were planted on April 28 by employees of FirstEnergy and its Ohio Edison electric company throughout the MetroParks' 402-acre farm in Canfield. Since April 2021, FirstEnergy has donated and planted more than 17,000 trees throughout its five-state service territory. The company is on track to plant more than 14,000 additional trees this spring. This initiative is an important part of the company's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, promote responsible use of natural resources and further the advancement of sustainable practices. Led by FirstEnergy's Green Team in northeast Ohio, the Mill Creek MetroParks tree-planting event is one of several projects employees will complete this year to help nearby parks, nature preserves and communities across FirstEnergy's entire footprint. \"FirstEnergy contributed the funds to cover the cost of the trees, and more than a dozen employee volunteers spent several hours planting them around the park, which will be enjoyed by the public and many of our local employees and their families,\" said Carol Trembly, senior scientist and Green Team leader at FirstEnergy. FirstEnergy's 10 Green Teams consist of employees from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia who volunteer their time and talents to support a wide variety of environmental initiatives. The groups plan to continue to partner with state park systems, watershed and recycling groups, garden clubs, schools and other environmentally focused organizations in the future to support FirstEnergy's commitment to building a brighter and more sustainable future. This year's donation of trees to Mill Creek MetroParks complements FirstEnergy's donation of 300 trees planted at the MetroParks' Collier Preserve last year on Earth Day. \"These trees will help restore forested habitat within the park that we've lost over the years, and we look forward to monitoring the trees and helping them along as they mature,\" said Nick Derico, natural resources manager at Mill Creek MetroParks. \"We appreciate FirstEnergy and Ohio Edison's commitment to preserving our local environment so that our trees and wildlife can continue to thrive for many years.\" In addition to the trees that were donated and planted at the Mill Creek MetroParks Farm, FirstEnergy plans to donate 400 trees to the Poland Municipal Forest in Poland on Friday, April 29, to celebrate Arbor Day.

A mixed variety of hardwood trees were planted on April 28 by employees of FirstEnergy and its Ohio Edison electric company throughout the MetroParks' 402-acre farm in Canfield. Since April 2021, FirstEnergy has donated and planted more than 17,000 trees throughout its five-state service territory. The company is on track to plant more than 14,000 additional trees this spring. This initiative is an important part of the company's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, promote responsible use of natural resources and further the advancement of sustainable practices. Led by FirstEnergy's Green Team in northeast Ohio, the Mill Creek MetroParks tree-planting event is one of several projects employees will complete this year to help nearby parks, nature preserves and communities across FirstEnergy's entire footprint. \"FirstEnergy contributed the funds to cover the cost of the trees, and more than a dozen employee volunteers spent several hours planting them around the park, which will be enjoyed by the public and many of our local employees and their families,\" said Carol Trembly, senior scientist and Green Team leader at FirstEnergy. FirstEnergy's 10 Green Teams consist of employees from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia who volunteer their time and talents to support a wide variety of environmental initiatives. The groups plan to continue to partner with state park systems, watershed and recycling groups, garden clubs, schools and other environmentally focused organizations in the future to support FirstEnergy's commitment to building a brighter and more sustainable future. This year's donation of trees to Mill Creek MetroParks complements FirstEnergy's donation of 300 trees planted at the MetroParks' Collier Preserve last year on Earth Day. \"These trees will help restore forested habitat within the park that we've lost over the years, and we look forward to monitoring the trees and helping them along as they mature,\" said Nick Derico, natural resources manager at Mill Creek MetroParks. \"We appreciate FirstEnergy and Ohio Edison's commitment to preserving our local environment so that our trees and wildlife can continue to thrive for many years.\" In addition to the trees that were donated and planted at the Mill Creek MetroParks Farm, FirstEnergy plans to donate 400 trees to the Poland Municipal Forest in Poland on Friday, April 29, to celebrate Arbor Day.
